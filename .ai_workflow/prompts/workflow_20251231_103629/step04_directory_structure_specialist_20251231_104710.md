## Prompt Content

**Role**: You are a senior software architect and technical documentation specialist with expertise in project structure conventions, architectural patterns, code organization best practices, and documentation alignment.

**Task**: Perform comprehensive validation of directory structure and architectural organization for this project.

**Context:**
- Project: ibira.js (No description available)
- Primary Language: javascript
- Total Directories: 57 (excluding build artifacts, dependencies, coverage)
- Scope: 
- Modified Files: {modified_count}
- Critical Directories Missing: 1
- Undocumented Directories: 13
- Documentation Mismatches: 0

**Phase 1 Automated Findings:**
Missing expected: tests
Undocumented: ./__tests__
Undocumented: ./src/workflow
Undocumented: ./src/utils
Undocumented: ./src/config
Undocumented: ./src/core
Undocumented: ./docs/referential_transparency
Undocumented: ./docs/prompts
Undocumented: ./.ai_workflow
Undocumented: ./.ai_workflow/logs
Undocumented: ./.ai_workflow/summaries
Undocumented: ./.ai_workflow/prompts
Undocumented: ./.ai_workflow/backlog
Undocumented: ./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
Doc organization: 2 files moved

**Current Directory Structure:**
.

│   ├── architecture
│   ├── guides
│   ├── misc
│   ├── prompts
│   ├── reference
│   ├── referential_transparency
│   ├── reports

│   ├── core
│   ├── utils
│   └── workflow
│       └── metrics
└── __tests__

21 directories

**Tasks:**

1. **Structure-to-Documentation Mapping:**
   - Verify directory structure matches documented architecture
   - Check that primary documentation describes actual structure
   - Validate directory purposes are clearly documented
   - Ensure new directories have documentation explaining their role

2. **Architectural Pattern Validation:**
   - Assess if directory organization follows language/framework best practices
   - Validate separation of concerns (src/, lib/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
   - Check for proper resource organization (assets, configs, data)
   - Verify module/component structure is logical and documented

3. **Naming Convention Consistency:**
   - Validate directory names follow consistent conventions
   - Check for naming pattern consistency across similar directories
   - Verify no ambiguous or confusing directory names
   - Ensure directory names are descriptive and self-documenting

4. **Best Practice Compliance:**
   {language_specific_directory_standards}
   # NOTE: This will be dynamically populated from language_specific_documentation[javascript]
   # If no language-specific standards exist, generic standards below are used
   - Source vs build output directory separation
   - Documentation organization (docs/ location and structure)
   - Configuration file locations (conventional paths)
   - Build artifact locations (proper gitignore coverage)

5. **Scalability and Maintainability Assessment:**
   - Directory depth appropriate (not too deep or too flat)
   - Related files properly grouped
   - Clear boundaries between modules/components
   - Easy to navigate structure for new developers
   - Potential restructuring recommendations

**Approach**: **Output:**
- List of structure issues with specific directory paths
- Documentation mismatches (documented but missing, or undocumented but present)
- Architectural pattern violations or inconsistencies
- Naming convention issues
- Best practice recommendations
- Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each issue
- Actionable remediation steps with rationale
- Suggested restructuring if needed (with migration impact assessment)

Please analyze the directory structure and provide a detailed architectural validation report.
